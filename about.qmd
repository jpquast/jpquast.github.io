Welcome to my website! My name is Jan-Philipp, but most people call me JP. I am a biochemist and currently pursuing my PhD in the Picotti Lab at ETH in Zurich, Switzerland. In my research I study protein-metal interactions using mass spectrometry and structural proteomics methods.

This website and blog serves as a platform for me to share tutorials and the various projects I am working on in my free time. In particular I enjoy automating processes both in the real world and digitally through robots and code. In my DIY projects I like combining computer-aided design (CAD) with 3D printing (both FDM and DLP), microcontroller based simple electronic circuits, and coding.

Through my PhD I have found a passion for the programming language R. I have contributed to the development of several R packages and are the maintainer of the packages [**protti**](https://jpquast.github.io/protti/) and [**ggplate**](https://jpquast.github.io/ggplate/).

If you are curious and have any questions or would like to discuss my work further please feel free to reach out to me. I am always open to collaborate on new and interesting projects!
